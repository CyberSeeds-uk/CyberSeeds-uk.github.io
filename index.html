    <!-- WHAT THIS IS -->
    <section class="about">
      <h2>What this is</h2>

      <p>
        Cyber Seeds is a quiet review of your home’s digital health.
        It looks at how your internet, devices, accounts, privacy,
        and children’s online experiences fit together —
        and where small changes can reduce risk and stress.
      </p>

      <ul class="principles">
        <li>No monitoring</li>
        <li>No judgement</li>
        <li>No technical pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SIGNALS -->
    <section class="signals">

      <div class="signal card-good">
        <h3>What’s working</h3>
        <p>
          In a typical household, the internet connection is stable,
          devices are mostly up to date, and nothing malicious is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most families are doing more right than they realise.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="signal card-attn">
        <h3>What needs attention</h3>
        <p>
          A reused password appears in an old data breach.
          The Wi-Fi router hasn’t been reviewed since installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scam messages arrive regularly,
          and a child’s device shares more information than intended.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="signal card-next">
        <h3>What to do next</h3>
        <p>
          Change two key passwords.
          Adjust one router setting.
          Review a single child privacy control together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small steps. Clear priorities. No overwhelm.
        </p>
      </div>

    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="value">
      <p class="value-line">
        This isn’t about locking everything down.
      </p>
      <p class="value-line">
        It’s about understanding your digital home —
        and making a few calm improvements that actually last.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>What you’re left with</h2>

      <p>
        After the check, families consistently report the same thing:
        they feel clearer.
        Not more worried — more oriented.
      </p>

      <ul class="outcomes">
        <li>You know what actually matters in your home</li>
        <li>You know what can safely be ignored for now</li>
        <li>You know the next small step — and why</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="outcome-note">
        No alerts. No dashboards. Just understanding.
