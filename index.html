    <!-- HERO -->
    <!--
      The hero introduces the product succinctly. The tight hierarchy and
      generous spacing allow the eye to flow naturally from the tagline
      through the headline to the call to action. The copy has been kept
      deliberately simple to align with the calm, premium tone of the
      product.

      <h2>What this is</h2>
      <p>
        Cyber Seeds is a quiet review of your home’s digital health. It looks
        at how your internet, devices, accounts, privacy and children’s
        experiences online fit together — and where small changes can reduce
        risk and stress.
      </p>
      <ul class="principles">
        <li>No monitoring</li>
        <li>No judgement</li>

    <!-- SIGNALS -->
    <!--
      Three coloured cards outline the signal framework. Each card
      implicitly references a typical household without over-explaining.
      The order – what’s working, what needs attention, what to do next –
      guides the reader through acknowledgement, identification and action.
    -->
    <section class="signals">
      <div class="signal card-good">
        <h3>What’s working</h3>
        <p>
          In a typical household, the internet connection is stable,
          devices are mostly up to date and nothing malicious is
          happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most families are doing more right than they realise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="signal card-attn">
        <h3>What needs attention</h3>
        <p>
          A reused password appears in an old data breach. The Wi‑Fi router
          hasn’t been reviewed since installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scam messages arrive regularly and a child’s device shares more
          information than intended.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="signal card-next">
        <h3>What to do next</h3>
        <p>
          Change two key passwords. Adjust one router setting. Review a
          single child privacy control together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small steps. Clear priorities. No overwhelm.

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <!--
      Articulate the guiding philosophy of Cyber Seeds. These two lines
      reframe cyber security as clarity and care, not fear. They sit
      between the signals and outcome sections to provide an interpretive
      pause.
    -->
    <section class="value">
      <p class="value-line">
        This isn’t about locking everything down.
      </p>
      <p class="value-line">
        It’s about understanding your digital home — and making a few
        calm improvements that actually last.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <!--
      The outcome section answers the question “What am I left with?”. A
      straightforward list emphasises clarity, orientation and next steps.
    -->
    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>What you’re left with</h2>
      <p>
        After the check, families consistently report the same thing: they
        feel clearer. Not more worried — more oriented.
      </p>
      <ul class="outcomes">
        <li>You know what actually matters in your home</li>
        <li>You know what can safely be ignored for now</li>
        <li>You know the next small step — and why</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="outcome-note">
        No alerts. No dashboards. Just understanding.
