      <h2>What this is</h2>

      <p>
        Cyber Seeds is not monitoring software.
        It is not parental control.
        And it is not another list of rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a structured review of your household’s digital environment —
        designed to give families clarity, proportion, and confidence.
