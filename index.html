    <p>Most families are doing their best.</p>

    <p>
      But homes have quietly become digital ecosystems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wi-Fi that everything depends on.<br />
      Phones that never really switch off.<br />
      Accounts, apps, and passwords spread across the household.
    </p>

    <p>
      A child watching videos upstairs.<br />
      A tablet that won’t update anymore.<br />
      A message that looks official — but isn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parents are expected to manage it all,
      without training, language, or support.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cyber Seeds exists to change that.

      Cyber Seeds is a household digital health check.
    </p>

    <p>
      It looks at the environment around your family —
      not individual behaviour.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Wi-Fi your home relies on — how it’s shared and secured
      </li>
      <li>
        Devices in the house — including older phones or tablets still in use
      </li>
      <li>
        Everyday digital habits — reused passwords, shared logins, forgotten accounts
      </li>
      <li>
        Messages and pressure entering the home — scam texts, fake emails, worrying alerts
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="quiet">
      No surveillance. No monitoring children. No technical jargon.

      This is a one-off household audit.
    </p>

    <p>
      No subscriptions. No follow-up sales calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll complete a short form about things you already know —
      devices, internet use, and any concerns you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t need technical knowledge.
      You don’t need perfect answers.
