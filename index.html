  <!-- WHAT IT IS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What this is</h2>

    <p>
      Cyber Seeds is not monitoring software.
      It’s not parental control.
      And it’s not another list of rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a structured review of your home’s digital environment —
      designed to give families clarity, proportion, and confidence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT IT COVERS -->

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Designed for families</h2>

    <p>
      Cyber Seeds is built on a simple principle:
      your home is a living digital environment —
      not a problem to be fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our role is not to scare, monitor, or judge.
      It is to bring clarity and stability,
      so families can make informed decisions at their own pace.
