  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section style="margin-top:4rem;">
    <h2>What this is</h2>

    <p>
      Cyber Seeds is not monitoring software.
      It is not parental control.
      And it is not another list of rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a structured review of your household’s digital environment —
      designed to give families clarity, proportion, and confidence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SCOPE -->
  <section style="margin-top:3rem;">
    <h2>What we look at</h2>

    <ul class="points">
      <li>Your home Wi-Fi and router setup</li>
      <li>Phones, tablets, laptops, consoles, and smart devices</li>
      <li>Privacy, accounts, and data exposure</li>
      <li>Scams, fraud, and digital pressure</li>
      <li>Children’s digital wellbeing and boundaries</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- OUTPUT -->
  <section style="margin-top:3rem;">
    <h2>What you receive</h2>

    <ul class="points">
      <li>A clear written household report</li>
      <li>A calm explanation of real risks, in plain language</li>
      <li>Practical actions you can take immediately or later</li>
      <li>No follow-up pressure</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section style="margin-top:3rem;">
    <h2>Designed for families</h2>

    <p>
      Your home is a living digital environment —
      not a system that needs policing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cyber Seeds exists to reduce noise, restore balance,
      and help families make informed decisions at their own pace.
