      <h2>What this is</h2>

      <p>
        Cyber Seeds helps families understand the health of their
        digital home — calmly, proportionately, and without judgement.
      </p>

      <p>
        We look at how your internet, devices, accounts, and children’s
        online experiences fit together, and where small changes
        can reduce risk and stress.

    <!-- OUTCOME -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What families say they gain</h2>

      <p>
        After a Cyber Seeds check, families usually say the same thing:
        they feel clearer — not more worried.
      </p>

      <ul class="outcomes">
        <li>You know what actually matters right now</li>
        <li>You know what can safely wait</li>
        <li>You know the next small step — and why</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="quiet">
        No alerts. No dashboards. Just understanding.
