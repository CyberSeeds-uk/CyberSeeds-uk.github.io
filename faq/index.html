    <!-- Q1 -->
    <h3>🌱 What exactly is a Digital MOT?</h3>
    <p>
      It’s a simple, guided digital-safety check for your home.

    </p>

    <!-- Q2 -->
    <h3>🧩 Do I need to be good with technology?</h3>
    <p>
      Not at all. Cyber Seeds was created for real families, not tech experts.  
      Everything is explained in a friendly, calm, human way — with zero jargon.
