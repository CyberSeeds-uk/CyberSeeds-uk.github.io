    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Who is Cyber Seeds for?</h3>
      <p>
        Cyber Seeds is for UK households that want calmer, safer digital lives: families with children, carers supporting
        elderly or vulnerable relatives, and shared homes with lots of connected devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need to be technical?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Sessions are built for non-technical people. We explain everything in plain language and guide you step-by-step.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this only for Manchester?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Remote sessions are available across the UK. In-person options may be available in parts of Greater Manchester.

  <section>
    <h2>About the Audit</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>What do you check?</h3>
      <p>
        We review your WiFi and router settings, device hygiene and updates, account security, privacy exposure and how
        children use their devices, apps and games. We also look at your scam and fraud risk.
      </p>

      <h3>Will you make changes during the session?</h3>
      <p>
        Where possible, yes. We aim to fix key issues live — such as improving WiFi passwords, enabling updates and turning
        on safer settings. Anything that takes longer becomes part of your written action plan.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
      <p>
        A standard audit usually takes 45–60 minutes. Follow-up sessions are around 30 minutes.
      </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do you keep my information?</h3>
      <p>
        We keep only what is needed to deliver the session and your written plan. Sensitive information is handled carefully
        and we do not sell or share your details. See our <a href="/cyberseeds/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for more.
      </p>

      <h3>Will you need access to passwords?</h3>
      <p>
        We never ask for your passwords. We may guide you to change them on your own screen while we talk you through it.
