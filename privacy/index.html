        Cyber Seeds exists to help households understand and care for their digital lives — calmly, safely, and without judgement.
        We take privacy seriously. This policy explains what data is involved, where it lives, and who controls it, in clear language.
      </p>
      <p class="muted" style="margin: 12px 0 0;">
        This policy is split into two parts, because Cyber Seeds works in two very different ways:
        <strong>(A)</strong> Snapshot Self-Check (local-only) and <strong>(B)</strong> Audit/Contact &amp; Services.

    <!-- =========================
         PART A — SNAPSHOT
    ========================== -->
    <section aria-labelledby="part-a">
      <h2 id="part-a">Part A — Snapshot Self-Check (Local-Only)</h2>

      <h3>What the Snapshot is</h3>
      <p>
        The Cyber Seeds Snapshot is a self-check tool that helps you reflect on your household’s digital setup across five lenses
        (devices, network, privacy, scams, and wellbeing). It is designed to be calm and non-judgemental, private by default,
        and safe for families to use independently.
      </p>

      <h3>Where Snapshot data lives</h3>
      <p><strong>Snapshot data is stored only on your device.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It runs entirely in your browser.</li>
        <li>It is saved using local browser storage.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> sent to Cyber Seeds.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> uploaded to any server.</li>
        <li>We cannot see it, access it, or recover it if you delete it or change device.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        This includes your answers to Snapshot questions, your household signal or lens indicators, any comparisons between snapshots,
        and any local history or progress.
      </p>

      <h3>Digital Passport exports</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to export a Digital Passport (JSON, PDF, or HTML), the file is created locally on your device.
        You choose whether to save, share, or delete it. Cyber Seeds does not receive a copy.
      </p>

      <h3>Clearing Snapshot data</h3>
      <p>
        You can remove Snapshot data at any time by using the “clear” or “reset” options on the site (where available),
        or by clearing your browser’s local storage / site data. Once cleared, the Snapshot history is permanently removed from that device.
      </p>

      <div class="card" style="padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Important to know</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Because the Snapshot is local-only, changing device or browser won’t automatically transfer your Snapshot history.</li>
          <li>If you clear your browser data, your Snapshot history may be erased.</li>
          <li>This is intentional — it protects your privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your rights</h3>

      <p>
        Cyber Seeds is designed to be family-safe and child-aware. We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children.

      <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
      <p>
        If we update this policy, we will keep the language clear and human, update the “Last updated” date,
        and never quietly change how Snapshot data works without making it explicit.
