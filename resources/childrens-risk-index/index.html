    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">Why This Matters</h2>
    <p class="resource-text">
      Children don’t see apps, chats and games the same way adults do.  
      To them, digital spaces feel playful, social and exciting — not risky.
      <br><br>
      Many online dangers build slowly and quietly:
      persuasive strangers, unmoderated chat rooms, content algorithms,  
      in-game voice channels, disappearing messages and reward-driven pressures.
      <br><br>
      This guide is designed to help adults understand those risks carefully  
      and respond calmly, without scaring children or creating fear around technology.
    </p>

    <!-- FACT BOX -->
    <div class="alert-box">
      <h3>What You Should Know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strangers can contact children in games even when chat “seems disabled”.</li>
        <li>Many apps aimed at younger children contain private or hidden messaging features.</li>
        <li>Algorithms can shift a child’s feed after a single mistaken click.</li>
        <li>Children often hide worrying experiences because they fear losing their device.</li>
        <li>Scammers increasingly target children with “free skins”, “codes” and fake competitions.</li>
        <li>Risk rises when children use headsets, join private servers or play late at night.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <!-- FIVE RISK AREAS -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">The 5 Digital Risk Areas</h2>

    <!-- RISK 1 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>1. Stranger Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Most games and social apps allow strangers to add or message children by default.  
        These interactions often begin casually and feel harmless at first.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>  
        Roblox friend invites, Fortnite party requests, Discord server pings,  
        Snapchat “Quick Add”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 2 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>2. Hidden Chat & Unmoderated Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Even child-friendly platforms have areas adults never see:  
        private servers, whisper messages, trade chats, team lobbies,  
        “invite-only” rooms or game-specific communication channels.
        <br><br>
        These spaces can carry inappropriate conversations without a child realising what’s happening.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 3 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>3. Manipulation, Pressure & Emotional Influence</h3>
      <p>
        Children can be pressured into sharing information,  
        sending photos, joining private calls, giving account details  
        or making in-game purchases.
        <br><br>
        Manipulation often looks like “friendship”, “team rewards”,  
        “trades”, “exclusive roles” or “helping someone”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 4 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>4. Unsafe Content Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        A single click on the wrong video can push more adult, violent,  
        harmful or disturbing content into their feed.
        <br><br>
        Recommendation algorithms adapt quickly — meaning exposure can snowball.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 5 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>5. In-Game Scams & Digital Fraud</h3>
      <p>
        Scammers know children respond to rewards, skins, coins and “rare items”.  
        Fake links, code generators and impersonation tactics are common.
        <br><br>
        Children often feel embarrassed when tricked, making them less likely to tell adults.
      </p>
    </div>


    <!-- HOW TO HELP SAFELY -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">How to Keep Children Safer</h2>

    <!-- TIP 1 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>1. Use Built-In Safety Settings</h3>
      <p>
        Turn off friend requests, direct messages, voice chat  
        and joining private servers unless necessary.  
        Most platforms now support family or parent controls.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 2 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>2. Set Up Devices Together</h3>
      <p>
        Sitting with your child during setup helps build trust  
        and ensures safe settings are applied from the very beginning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 3 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>3. Keep Gaming & App Use in Shared Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping devices in visible areas reduces secret chats,  
        late-night activity and hidden interactions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 4 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>4. Create an “Open Door” Digital Culture</h3>
      <p>
        Children should feel safe telling you something has gone wrong.  
        Reassure them that honesty never results in losing their device.  
        This single shift increases disclosure dramatically.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 5 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>5. Teach the “Pause & Check” Habit</h3>
      <p>
        A gentle rule:  
        <strong>If something feels odd, strange or too good to be true — pause and ask first.</strong>
        <br><br>
        This habit prevents the majority of online mistakes.
