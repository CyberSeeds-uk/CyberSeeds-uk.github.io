    Gaming chats, apps and social platforms expose children to risks long before parents ever see them.  
    This guide helps you understand those risks — calmly and clearly.

    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">Why This Matters</h2>
    <p class="resource-text">
      Children move through digital worlds quickly — games, chats, livestreams, private messages,  
      friend requests and new “features” appearing every week.
      <br><br>
      Many of the risks they face are invisible to adults:
      social pressure, persuasive strangers, hidden chat channels, in-game voice calls,  
      disappearing messages, and algorithm-driven content that isn’t always child-safe.
    </p>

    <!-- FACT BOX -->
    <div class="alert-box">
      <h3>What You Should Know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most gaming platforms allow strangers to message children by default.</li>
        <li>Many “kid-friendly” apps include private chat rooms or voice channels.</li>
        <li>Algorithms quickly push risky content if a child clicks the wrong thing once.</li>
        <li>Children rarely report issues immediately — they fear losing access to games or devices.</li>
        <li>Scams now target children through gaming skins, codes and “free rewards”.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <!-- SECTION: THE FIVE RISK AREAS -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">The 5 Digital Risk Areas</h2>

    <!-- RISK 1 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>1. Stranger Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        Most online games and apps allow strangers to send friend requests,  
        voice chat or direct message children unless settings are changed.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Roblox servers, Fortnite parties, Snapchat friend suggestions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 2 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>2. Hidden Chat & Private Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Platforms often contain unmoderated channels adults never see:  
        private servers, whisper messages, “trade chats”, party chats or invite-only groups.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 3 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>3. Manipulation & Pressure</h3>
      <p>
        Children can be pressured into sharing photos, joining private calls,  
        sending personal details or making in-game purchases.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 4 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>4. Unsafe Content Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        A single wrong click can trigger algorithms to recommend violent,  
        sexual, harmful or adult content far beyond a child’s age.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RISK 5 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>5. In-Game Scams & Fraud Tricks</h3>
      <p>
        Scammers target children through fake competitions,  
        “free skin generators”, reward codes or impersonating moderators.
      </p>
    </div>


    <!-- HOW TO HELP SAFELY -->
    <h2 class="resource-heading">How to Keep Children Safer</h2>

    <!-- TIP 1 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>1. Use App & Game Safety Settings</h3>
      <p>
        Most platforms now offer parental controls that disable  
        chat, friend requests, private servers and voice calls.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 2 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>2. Sit With Them During Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Setting up a device or game together builds trust and lets you  
        shape safety before they dive in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 3 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>3. Keep Devices in Shared Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Children are safer when digital interactions happen in visible spaces,  
        reducing secret chats and late-night activity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 4 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>4. Build an “Open Door” Culture</h3>
      <p>
        Children need to know they can tell you anything without losing access  
        to games or devices.  
        A calm, non-judgemental approach increases honesty.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TIP 5 -->
    <div class="step">
      <h3>5. Teach Them “Pause & Check”</h3>
      <p>
        A simple rule: if something feels strange, pause and ask first.  
        This single habit prevents the majority of online mistakes.
