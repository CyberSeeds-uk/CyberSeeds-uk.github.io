        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Children spend time on platforms designed with complexity, hidden features and social mechanics that even adults don’t fully understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Games like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft and social apps like TikTok give children access to millions of strangers — often without realising it.
        </p>

          <strong>What You Should Know:</strong>
          <ul style="margin-top:10px;padding-left:20px;line-height:1.6;">
            <li>Children often talk to strangers through in-game chat, voice chat and friend requests.</li>
            <li>Games contain private servers, hidden chats and unmoderated spaces.</li>
            <li>Scammers target children because they respond quickly and trust easily.</li>
            <li>Children rarely report worrying interactions because they fear losing their devices or privileges.</li>
            <li>Many parents never see the chats, invites or server history children receive.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Hidden Risks</h2>

        <h3>1. In-Game Chat</h3>
        <p>
          Many games allow strangers to message children directly. Even kid-friendly platforms include public, private and group chats.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Friend Requests from Unknown Players</h3>
        <p>
          Children accept friend requests quickly, often thinking “it’s just a game” — not realising strangers can message them privately.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Private Servers</h3>
        <p>
          Some Roblox, Minecraft and Discord communities run private servers with no moderation. Children can be exposed to inappropriate behaviour or scary content.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Scams, Robux Theft & Phishing</h3>
        <p>
          Children are often lured by free currency, items or skins — leading to account loss, data exposure or unwanted conversations with older users.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Pressure, Bullying & Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
          Children may feel pressured to join certain games, share personal information or send voice notes to “fit in”.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Reduce the Risks</h2>

        <h3>1. Turn On Privacy & Chat Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          Most platforms include strong parental controls. Restrict messages to “Friends Only” or disable them completely.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Review Friends Lists Weekly</h3>
        <p>
          Help your child understand who is a friend and who is not. Remove unknown or suspicious accounts.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Keep Devices in Shared Family Areas</h3>
        <p>
          Children are less likely to hide worrying interactions when they feel supported rather than monitored.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Talk Openly About Online Safety</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of punishment, focus on curiosity: “If anything online makes you uncomfortable, tell me — you won't get in trouble.”
        </p>

        <h3>5. Avoid Allowing Children on Adult Platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Discord, Snapchat, and some Roblox servers are designed for older audiences. Review the minimum age recommendations.
