    <h1>About Cyber Seeds</h1>

    <p style="max-width: 780px; margin-top: 20px;">
      Cyber Seeds is the UK’s first family-centric digital safety and home cyber-defence service.
      We help households protect their Wi-Fi, secure their devices, reduce digital risks, prevent scams and guide children safely through online life.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width: 780px;">
      Our mission is simple: to give real UK families the same level of cyber protection that modern businesses rely on — but without complexity, jargon or judgement. You don’t need to understand cybersecurity. You just need clear steps and a trusted advisor.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width: 780px;">
      We bring together cybersecurity expertise, psychology, child-safety awareness and practical guidance to create a safer everyday digital experience for everyone in your home.
